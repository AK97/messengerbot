# messengerbot
This is a facebook messenger bot that acts as a sort of virtual assistant.  
As it stands it's NSFW, but can easily be stripped of its swearing and drug references.  
It can also do some funny things like yell at a designated annoying friend every now and then.  
It uses a variety of web APIs to deliver some handy information upon request.  
This project was inspired by a more meme-centric bot written by @tarungog et al.  
This repo attempts to be an adaptation with cleaner code and easy customizability.  
It's a little hard to imagine "legitimate" use cases for such a bot but who knows. An AI robot will probably be a staple of every group chat in the future ðŸ¤–.
